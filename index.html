      <strong> How to plan the perfect tropical vacation </strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
      Based on my experience, I will show you what a
      <font size="+2"> dream vacation </font> in a tropical place should look
      like!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        First off, you want to make sure that the place has a
        <em> beautiful, clean, turquoise colored and white sand beach</em>.
        Ideally, it should look like this:
      </li>
    </ul>

      width="350"
    />

    <h2 id="nice-hotel">Make sure to have a nice hotel!</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        It is important to sleep in a clean, luxourious environment. Imagine
        waking up to this view?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Last but not least, the most important part, <mark>food!</mark></h1>

        it is significant that the food you are eating is
        <strong>delicious </strong>, maybe a buffet that looks like this?:
